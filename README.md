– SQLite Sales Data Analysis

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using SQLite, Python (pandas & matplotlib), and randomly generated sales data.

Overview
	•	Created a SQLite database sales_data.db with a sales table.
	•	Programmatically inserted 10 rows of randomized sales records.
	•	Queried the database to calculate total quantity and revenue per product.
	•	Visualized the total revenue using a bar chart.
	•	Saved the visualization as sales_chart.png.

Tools & Libraries
	•	Python
	•	SQLite3
	•	pandas
	•	matplotlib

This bar chart helps quickly identify which products contributed the most to overall revenue. It’s a simple yet powerful way to present sales performance at a glance.




Key Highlights
	•	Dynamic table creation and data insertion using Python.
	•	SQL aggregation queries for revenue and quantity analysis.
	•	Simple, clean data visualization to support insights.
	•	Modular and well-commented code for easy understanding and reuse.
